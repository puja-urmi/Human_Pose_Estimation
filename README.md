Welcome! This repository is dedicated to human pose estimation leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically utilizing CNNs. In our notebook script, 'pose_estimator.ipynb,' we delve into code implementing regression to identify 14 key points of the human body. Our findings and insights are documented in the reports.

Notably, after approximately 15 epochs, our model achieved an impressive MSE of 0.0878. Please note, due to size constraints on GitHub, we're unable to share the weights. However, our ongoing work involves exploring alternative approaches for improved accuracy and efficiency in pose estimation.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to innovate and enhance our methodologies in this exciting domain!
